Features

- **Routing & Navigation:**  
  Seamless navigation between multiple pages including:
  - **Home**
  - **Sorting**
  - **Searching**

- **Interactive Controls:**  
  Each visualizer includes controls for:
  - **Play / Pause / Stop:** Manage the algorithm animation.
  - **Speed Adjustment:** Control the speed of visualizations.
  - **Array Size:** Increase or decrease the number of elements.
  - **Custom Array Input:** Experiment with your own array values.

- **Sorting Visualizations:**  
  Watch and compare the following algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Searching Visualizations:**  
  Visualize the following search algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- **Race Mode (Sorting Page):**  
  Compare two sorting algorithms side-by-side in real time:
  - **Real-time Progress Bar:** Track algorithm progress with visual indicators.
  - **Race Comparison:** Head-to-head comparison of sorting performance.
  - **Leaderboard:** View win/lose records based on algorithm performance.

## Pages & Algorithms

### Home
- **Overview Page:**  
  An introduction to the project, its purpose, and how to navigate the application.

### Sorting Page
- **Sorting Algorithms Visualized:**
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
- **Race Mode:**  
  Engage in a race mode where you can compare two sorting algorithms in real-time. Watch them compete with animated progress indicators, and check out the leaderboard to see the win/lose record.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the Project:**  
   Open the application and use the routing menu to switch between the Home, Sorting, and Searching pages.

2. **Select an Algorithm:**  
   On the Sorting or Searching pages, choose the algorithm you want to visualize.

3. **Control the Animation:**  
   Use the play, pause, and stop controls to manage the animation. Adjust the speed and array size or provide a custom array to see how the algorithm behaves under different conditions.

4. **Race Mode (Sorting Only):**  
   Enable race mode on the Sorting page to compare two algorithms simultaneously. Watch their progress in real time and view performance metrics on the leaderboard.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manish-792/dsavisualiser2.git
   cd dsavisualiser2
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser:**  
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified by your setup) to see the visualizer in action.
